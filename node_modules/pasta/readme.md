#Pasta

A collection of functions that I have found myself copy pastaing around.

This is a personal utility library, maintained as a single repo and package
for the sake of convenience. Individual functions are intended to be
required out like `var log = require('pasta/log')`. Plain `require('pasta')`
includes all utilities, and is only intended for interactive use and debugging.
Tests and documentation live along side each utility.

Some of the more generally useful utilities are published under their own names,
noted in the list below.
